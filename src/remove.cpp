/*
To uninstall packages , we'll use the location data ( all the files that were installed by the program )
If you want more detail go to store_spm() in spm.cpp
So we have all list of all thoses file in a json array inside the package's spm file in DATA_DIR
(each package have a spm file in the DATA_DIR , and each spm file contains a json array of all the files that were installed by the program)
And we will cycle through all the files in the json array and remove them from the system.

This is simple . It could be simpler but really i dont know how .
So dont touch this , except if there are a critical bug or an important missing feature.
