    All hte complexity in this function and really in this entire project if just because we need to track  files installed by a makefile
    For now we juste install in a separate directory (BUILD_DIR) and then move it to the correct location (The real filesystem)
    I tried many solutions to do this like installwatch , checkinstall , but none of them worked for me.
    If you have an idea PLEASE , I beg you tell me or write it directly here .
    IDEAS :
    - 
    -
    -
    I prefer simple solution that deosnt include to write a timestamp based install-log thing from scratch
    (I tried , but its not good enough)

        We have some problems here , because some complex packages require advanced options to be installed 
        (like glibc that wants a separate build dir )
        For nom i resolved that by adding more complexity to the build commands , but its not pretty.
        So i dont know i we should implement these options directly here and drop a lot of performance juste for a small number of packages 
        or if we leave like that with some ugly command in the .spm file
        If you come across this you can vote :

        change -> 0
        keep like that -> 1

        Also this code is very bad so if you dont understand it dm me on discord : PKD667#9879 .
