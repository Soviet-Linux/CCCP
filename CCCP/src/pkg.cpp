Hi guys , I hope you'll have fun reading all of this 
If you can help me on improving it it would be great
PS : all of this is a little hacky , i know , but i'm not sure how to make it better
PS2: All of these includes are not needed but im to lazy to remove them

To uninstall packages , we'll use the location data ( all the files that were installed by the program )
If you want more detail go to store_spm() in spm.cpp
So we have all list of all thoses file in a json array inside the package's spm file in DATA_DIR
(each package have a spm file in the DATA_DIR , and each spm file contains a json array of all the files that were installed by the program)
And we will cycle through all the files in the json array and remove them from the system.

This is simple . It could be simpler but really i dont know how .
So dont touch this , except if there are a critical bug or an important missing feature.

    All hte complexity in this function and really in this entire project if just because we need to track  files installed by a makefile
    For now we juste install in a separate directory (BUILD_DIR) and then move it to the correct location (The real filesystem)
    I tried many solutions to do this like installwatch , checkinstall , but none of them worked for me.
    If you have an idea PLEASE , I beg you tell me or write it directly here .
    IDEAS :
    - 
    -
    -
    I prefer simple solution that deosnt include to write a timestamp based install-log thing from scratch
